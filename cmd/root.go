	Long: `Hecate is a command-line tool designed to simplify the management and configuration 
of your reverse proxy setup. It provides a unified interface for tasks such as deploying, 
updating, and monitoring your proxy environment.

Examples:
	# Display the help information for Hecate
  	hecate --help

  	# Deploy a new reverse proxy configuration for a specific application
  	hecate deploy jenkins
   	hecate deploy nextcloud
    	hecate deploy delphi

 	# Check the status of your reverse proxy services
  	hecate inspect

Use Hecate to quickly generate configuration files, manage certificates, and streamline 
the deployment process for your reverse proxy setup.`,
